I am an undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 


My current research interest lies in Computer Vision, especially Multimodal Learning and Motion Learning, and I am also willing to explore additional domains within the field of artificial intelligence in the future.
